Word Prediction for augmentative communication using markov model hypothesis

1)Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) encompasses the communication methods used to supplement or replace speech or writing for those with impairments in the production or comprehension of spoken or written language.AAC is used by those with a wide range of speech and language impairments, including congenital impairments such as cerebral palsy, intellectual impairment and autism, and acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. AAC can be a permanent addition to a person's communication or a temporary aid.


2)In probability theory, a Markov model is a stochastic model used to randomly changing systems. It is assumed that future states depend only on the current state, not on the events that occurred before it .

3)In our project alongwith Visualizations, we have tried to include sentimental analysis as well.
