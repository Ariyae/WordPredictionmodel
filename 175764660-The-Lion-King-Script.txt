THE PLACE The African Savannah. CAST OF CHARACTERS MUFASA: Current King of the Pride Lands. Well-built lion. Thick mane. Father of Simba. Older brother of Scar. SARABI [Mirage]: Mother of Simba. Wife of Mufasa. Queen and leader of the lionesses. SIMBA [Lion] : The cub of Mufasa. Soon to be King of Pride Rock. Initially a cub, later an adult. As an adult, he’s not as well built as his father was. Friend of Pumbaa and Timon. NALA: Friend and companion of Simba. She can pin Simba in a wrestling match. As an adult, she and Simba fall in love, prolonging a tradition they refused as cubs. SARAFINA: Nala’s mother. Friend of Sarabi. RAFIKI [Friend] : A mandrill whose role is of a mystical shaman. Outwardly she appears to be crazy, but in reality she is very wise. ZAZU: The King’s loyal servant. A hornbill, which is a large-beaked bird. SCAR: Younger brother of Mufasa. Uncle of Simba. Well chiseled, bony features. Flat black matted mane. Aspires to be King of Pride Rock by deceit, due to his thin size and weak stature. His claws are always partly extended. Has a vertical scar around his right eye that presumably accounts for his name. SHENZI [Uncouth] : Female hyena in the trio. Major attitude. Probably the smartest and deals the best with Scar. Most even temper. BANZAI [Skulk/Lurk] : Most quick tempered hyena. Best with come backs. Offsets Shenzi and Ed quite well. ED: The stupidest hyena. He has a Bill the Cat stare. Noted by warts on the tongue and holes in the ears. Too stupid or slow to lie at the right time. TIMON: An outcast meerkat; the wisecracking friend of Pumbaa. Very self-reliant, quite a fast talker (like a used car salesman). Small and thin in size. PUMBAA [Simpleton] : A well-padded warthog and the big-hearted friend of Timon. A little slow, but when he catches on, it’s surprising what he can do. Has a flatulence problem.

FROM THE DAY WE ARRIVE ON THIS PLANET INGONYAMA NENGW‘ ENEMABALA... AND BLINKING STEP INTO THE SUN. THERE IS MORE TO SEE THAN CAN EVER BE SEEN, MORE TO DO THAN CAN EVER BE DONE THERE IS FAR TOO MUCH TO TAKE IN HERE. MORE TO FIND THAN CAN EVER BE FOUND. BUT THE SUN ROLLING HIGH THROUGH THE SAPPHIRE SKY KEEPS GREAT AND SMALL ON THE ENDLESS ROUND. (Mufasa is on Pride Rock with Zazu.) IT’S THE CIRCLE OF LIFE, AND IT MOVES US ALL(Zazu bows to Mufasa, who smiles and nods at him.) THROUGH DESPAIR AND HOPE, THROUGH FAITH AND LOVE. (Appearance of Rafiki, the mandrill. She passes between ranks of animals, who bow to her; she then climbs Pride Rock to where Mufasa is standing.) TILL WE FIND OUR PLACE ON THE PATH UNWINDING (Rafiki and Mufasa embrace.)

IN THE CIRCLE THE CIRCLE OF LIFE (Mufasa leads Rafiki over to Sarabi, who is holding Simba. Rafiki puts the juice and sand she collects on Simba's brow, a ceremonial crown. She then picks Simba up and ascends to the point of Pride Rock. Mufasa and Sarabi follow. With a crescendo in the music and a restatement of the refrain, Rafiki holds Simba up for the crowd to view.) RAFIKI BABA TU, BA... BABA TU HALALA HALALA HALALA... HALALA HALALA HALALA HALALA... HALALA RAFIKI AND ENSEMBLE IT’S THE CIRCLE OF LIFE (The crowd starts howling, stamping, etc...) AND IT MOVES US ALL THROUGH DESPAIR AND HOPE THROUGH FAITH AND LOVE (The clouds part and a sunbeam highlights Rafiki and Simba on Pride Rock.) TILL WE FIND OUR PLACE (The crowd bows down, one by one.) ON THE PATH UNWINDING IN THE CIRCLE THE CIRCLE OF LIFE (Animals and vegetation of the Pride Lands celebrate the birth of a King’s cub. Rafiki departs through the celebration to her baobab tree where she will anoint Simba’s drawing. Mufasa through a non-heard conversation with Zazu Regarding the absence of Scar, depart at some point with the intention of going to Scar’s cave.) “GRASSLANDS CHANT” MALE ENSEMBLE ZUM, ZUM, ZUM, ZUM, ZUM, ZUM FEMALE ENSEMBLE MAMAYE, MAMAYE, MAMA-YE MAMAYE

SCENE 2 SCAR’S CAVE (Scar holding the squeaking and struggling mouse in his paw. He talks to it while playing with it.) SCAR Life's not fair, is it? You see I... well, I... shall never be King. (Exhales lightly.) And you... shall never see the light of another day. (Closed-mouth laughter. Starts to place the mouse on his extended tongue) ... Adieu... (Quiet laugh.) ZAZU (Interrupting.) Didn't your mother ever tell you not to play with your food? SCAR (Light sigh. The mouse is under his paw.) What do you want? ZAZU I'm here to announce that King Mufasa is on his way. (Bows.) ...So you'd better have a good excuse for missing the ceremony this morning. (The mouse runs away from Scar.) SCAR Oh now look, Zazu; you've made me lose my lunch! ZAZU Hah! You'll lose more than that when the King gets through with you. He's as mad as a hippo with a hernia. SCAR Oooh... I quiver with fear. (On "fear" Scar crouches down and is baring his teeth at Zazu.) ZAZU (Very concerned.) Now Scar, don't look at me that way... help ! (Scar quickly pounces on the bird.) MUFASA (Almost immediately.) Scar! SCAR (Mouth full.) Mm-hmm?

MUFASA Drop him. ZAZU (Speaking from Scar's mouth.) Impeccable timing, Your Majesty. (Scar spits the bird out.) (Slimed.) Eyyccch. SCAR (Sarcastically overjoyed.) Why! If it isn't my big brother descending from on high to mingle with the commoners. MUFASA Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba. SCAR (Faking astonishment.) That was today?! Oh, I feel simply awful. (He turns and starts scraping his claws on the rock wall. Zazu cringes at the sound.) (Admiring his claws.)... Must have slipped my mind. ZAZU Yes, well, as slippery as your mind is, as the King's brother, you should have been first in line! (Scar clicks his teeth at Zazu, who has flown near his face. Zazu takes cover behind Mufasa's foreleg. Scar bends down to speak to him.) SCAR Well, I was first in line... until the little hairball was born. MUFASA (Lowering his head and meeting Scar eye to eye.) That "hairball" is my son... and your future King. SCAR Ohh, I shall practice my curtsy. (Scar turns away and starts to exit.) MUFASA (Warning.) Don't you turn your back on me, Scar!

SCAR (Looking back.) Oh, no, Mufasa. Perhaps you shouldn't turn your back on me. MUFASA (Roars and literally jumps in front of Scar, baring his teeth for the first time.) Is that a challenge? SCAR Temper, temper. I wouldn't dream of challenging you. ZAZU Pity! Why not? SCAR (Looking at Zazu.) Well, as far as brains go, I got the lion's share. But, when it comes to brute strength (looking at Mufasa)... I'm afraid I'm at the shallow end of the gene pool. (Scar exits while Mufasa and Zazu climb Pride Rock.) ZAZU (Deep sigh.) There's one in every family, Sire... two in mine, actually. (Perches on Mufasa's shoulder.) And they always manage to ruin special occasions. MUFASA What am I going to do with him? ZAZU He'd make a very handsome throw rug. MUFASA (Chiding.) Zazu! ZAZU And just think! Whenever he gets dirty, you could take him out and beat him. BLACKOUT

SCENE 3 PRIDE LANDS (Early morning.) MUFASA Simba, now that you have grown some, it is important for you to receive some lessons. Everything the light touches is our kingdom. YOUNG SIMBA Wow! MUFASA A King's time as ruler rises and falls like the sun. One day, Simba, the sun will set on my time here, and will rise with you as the new King. YOUNG SIMBA And this will all be mine? MUFASA Everything. YOUNG SIMBA Everything the light touches?! What about that shadowy place? MUFASA That's beyond our borders. You must never go there, Simba. YOUNG SIMBA But I thought a King can do whatever he wants. MUFASA Oh, there's more to being King than... getting your way all the time. (Mufasa and Young Simba walk down from Pride Rock.) YOUNG SIMBA (Awed.) There's more?

MUFASA (Chuckles.) Simba... Everything you see exists together, in a delicate balance. As King, you need to understand that balance, and respect all the creatures... from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope. YOUNG SIMBA But, Dad, don't we eat the antelope? MUFASA Yes, Simba, but let me explain. When we die, our bodies become the grass. And the antelope eat the grass. And so we are all connected in the great Circle of Life. ZAZU (Lights on a nearby rock.) Good morning, Sire! MUFASA Good morning, Zazu. ZAZU Checking in... with the morning report. MUFASA Fire away. “THE MORNING REPORT” ZAZU IT’S AN HONOR AND A PRIVILEGE, A DUTY I PERFORMM WITH DUE SENSE OF DECORUM AND WITH PRIDE. WITH DEFERENCE AND GREAT RESPECT VERY MUCH THE NORM, PLUS A HINT OF SYCOPHANCY ON THE SIDE. TO LAY BEFORE MY RULER ALL THE FACTS ABOUT HIS REALMM TO FILL HIM IN ON ALL THE BEASTLY NEWS. MUFASA Yes, yes, Zazu, get on with it! ZAZU IN ORDER THAT HIS MAJESTY STANDS STURDY AT THE HELM, AWARE OF ALL THE FAUNA’S LATEST VIEWS.

MUFASA Zazu! The morning report! ZAZU Er... yes, Sire... the morning report... (Mufasa starts losing interest with the excess information while he is observing young Simba who is pouncing around on unseen insects.) CHIMPS ARE GOING APE, GIRAFFES REMAIN ABOVE IT ALL. ELEPHANTS REMEMBER, THOUGH JUST WHAT I CAN’T RECALL. CROCODILES ARE SNAPPING UP FRESH OFFERS FROM THE BANKS. SHOWED INTEREST IN MY NEST EGG BUT I QUICKLY SAID, “NO THANKS!” WE HAVEN’T PAID THE HORNBILLS AND THE VULTURES HAVE A HUNCH NOT EVERYONE INVITED WILL BE COMING BACK FOR LUNCH ! THIS IS THE MORNING REPORT, GIVES YOU THE LONG AND THE SHORT. EVERY GRUNT, ROAR, AND SNORT. NOT A TALE I DISTORT ON THE MORNING REPORT! (Mufasa and Young Simba start a side conversation while Zazu continues not noticing Mufasa’s lack of attention.) MUFASA What are you doing, son? YOUNG SIMBA (Disappointedly looking at his paws.) Pouncing. MUFASA Ah, let an old pro show you how it's done. ZAZU THE BUFFALO HAVE GOT A BEEF ABOUT THIS SEASON’S GRASS, WARTHOGS HAVE BEEN THWARTED IN ATTEMPTS TO SAVE THEIR GAS. FLAMINGOES IN THE PINK AND

MUFASA STAY LOW TO THE GROUND. YOUNG SIMBA YEAH, STAY LOW! MUFASA

CHASING SECRETARY BIRDS. SAFFRON IS THIS SEASON’S COLOR SEEN IN ALL THE HERDS. MOVING DOWN THE RANK AND FILE TO NEAR THE BOTTOM RUNG, ZAZU FAR TO MANY BEETLES ARE QUITE FRANKLY IN THE DUNG! MUFASA Then pounce! ZAZU Aaaaaak!

Shh, NOT A SOUND.

TAKE IT SLOW

(Young Simba does a full pounce on Zazu whom is completely stunned while Mufasa laughs.) MUFASA Ha, ha, ha, ha! YOUNG SIMBA THIS IS THE MORNING REPORT, GIVES YOU THE LONG AND THE SHORT. EVERY GRUNT, ROAR, AND SNORT. NOT A TALE I DISTORT, ON THE MORNING REPORT! MUFASA, ZAZU, YOUNG SIMBA, AND ENSEMBLE THIS IS THE MORNING REPORT, GIVES YOU THE LONG AND THE SHORT. EVERY GRUNT, ROAR, AND SNORT. NOT A TALE I DISTORT, ON THE MORNING REPORT! MUFASA (Still laughing.) Very good son! (A gopher emerges next to Zazu.) GOPHER Zazu!

ZAZU (Exasperated.) Yes? GOPHER (Saluting.) Sir, news from the underground. (They chat in secret.) MUFASA (To Simba.) Now, this time... ZAZU (Interrupting and with urgency.) Sire! Hyenas! In the Pride Lands! MUFASA (Serious now.) Zazu, take Simba home. YOUNG SIMBA Oh, Dad, can't I come? MUFASA (Curtly.) No, son. (Mufasa heads off at a full gallop while Zazu and Simba start moving out.) YOUNG SIMBA I never get to go anywhere. ZAZU Oh, young master, one day you will be King; then you can chase those slobbery, mangy, stupid poachers from dawn until dusk. BLACKOUT

SCENE 4 SCAR’S CAVE (Scar kicks an old bone from his cave as Young Simba enters.) YOUNG SIMBA Hey Uncle Scar! Guess what! SCAR I despise guessing games. YOUNG SIMBA I'm going to be King of Pride Rock. SCAR (Sarcastically) Oh, goody. YOUNG SIMBA (Looking out over the edge of the rock.) My dad just showed me the whole kingdom. (Greedily.) And I'm going to rule it all. Heh, heh. SCAR Yes. Well... forgive me for not leaping for joy. Bad back, you know. (Scar flops down on his side.) YOUNG SIMBA Hey, Uncle Scar? When I'm King, what will that make you? SCAR A monkey's uncle. YOUNG SIMBA Heh, heh. You're so weird. SCAR You have no idea. ...So, your father showed you the whole kingdom, did he? YOUNG SIMBA Everything. SCAR He didn't show you what's beyond that rise at the northern border...?

YOUNG SIMBA (Disappointed.) Well, no... he said I can't go there. SCAR And he's absolutely right. It's far too dangerous. Only the bravest lions go there. YOUNG SIMBA Well, I'm brave! What's out th... SCAR (Interrupting.) No, I'm sorry, Simba, I just can't tell you. YOUNG SIMBA Why not? SCAR Simba, Simba, I'm only looking out for the well-being of my favorite nephew. (Scar rubs and pats Young Simba's head.) YOUNG SIMBA (Snorts sarcastically.) Yeah, right, I'm your only nephew. SCAR All the more reason for me to be protective... An elephant graveyard is no place for a young prince... (Faking surprise.) Oops! YOUNG SIMBA (Enthusiastic.) An elephant what? Whoa! SCAR (Faking dismay.) Oh dear, I've said too much... Well, I suppose you'd have found sooner or later, you being so clever and all... (Pulling Young Simba near.) Oh, just do me one favor... promise me you'll never visit that dreadful place. YOUNG SIMBA (Thinks.) No problem. SCAR There’s a good lad. You run along now and have fun. And remember... it’s our little secret. (Young Simba leaves the rock. Scar walks away with an evil smile.) BLACKOUT

YOUNG NALA Hi, Simba. YOUNG SIMBA Come on. I just heard about this great place. YOUNG NALA So where are we going? It better not be anyplace dumb. (Sarabi and Sarafina approach them.) YOUNG SIMBA No. It's really cool. SARABI So where is this "really cool" place? YOUNG SIMBA Oh. (Thinks.) Uh... around the water hole. YOUNG NALA The water hole? What's so great about the water hole? YOUNG SIMBA (Whispering.) I'll show you when we get there. YOUNG NALA (Whispering.) Oh. (Normal volume.) Uh... Mom, can I go with Simba? SARAFINA Hmm... What do you think, Sarabi? SARABI Well, Sarafina... YOUNG SIMBA AND YOUNG NALA (Through broad, forced grins.) Pleeeease? SARABI It's all right with me... (Young Nala and Young Simba are overjoyed.) YOUNG NALA All right!

YOUNG SIMBA Yeah! SARABI ...As long as Zazu goes with you. (Young Simba and Young Nala stop dead in their celebration.) YOUNG SIMBA No! Not Zazu! SARABI AND SARAFINA Yes Zazu! (Zazu comes in.) ZAZU Yes, Madame. You called? SARABI Can you please accompany Nala and Simba to the waterhole? ZAZU Yes, Madame, of course. (Lionesses depart as the trio takes some steps.) ZAZU Step lively. The sooner we get to the water hole, the sooner we can leave. YOUNG NALA (Whispering.) So where are we really going? YOUNG SIMBA (Whispering.) An elephant graveyard! YOUNG NALA Wow! YOUNG SIMBA (Whispering.) Shhh! Zazu. YOUNG NALA (Whispering.) Right. So how are we gonna ditch the dodo? (The cubs continue whispering back and forth.)

YOUNG SIMBA (Whispering.) Oh, I know how we can... YOUNG NALA Yes, look if we... (and continues whispering into Young Simba’s ear.) ZAZU (Flying down.) Oh, just look at you two! Little seeds of romance blossoming in the savannah. Your parents will be thrilled... (he lands in front of them.)...with your being betrothed and all. YOUNG SIMBA Be-what? ZAZU Betrothed. Intended. Affianced. YOUNG NALA Meaning...? ZAZU (As though holding on to his coat lapels.) One day, you two are going to be married! YOUNG SIMBA Yuck! YOUNG NALA Ewww! YOUNG SIMBA I can't marry her! She's my friend. YOUNG NALA Yeah. It'd be too weird. ZAZU Well, sorry to burst your bubble, but you two turtle-doves have no choice. It's a tradition... (Young Simba mimics Zazu during these last words.) ...going back generations. YOUNG SIMBA Well, when I'm King, that'll be the first thing to go. ZAZU Not so long as I'm around.

YOUNG SIMBA Well, in that case, you're fired! ZAZU Hmmm... Nice try, but only the King can do that. (Pokes Simba's nose.) YOUNG NALA Well, he's the future King. YOUNG SIMBA Yeah. (Thumping Zazu's chest.) So you have to do what I tell you. ZAZU Not yet I don't. And with an attitude like that, I'm afraid you're shaping up to be a pretty pathetic King, indeed. YOUNG SIMBA Hmph. Not the way I see it. (Full song, colors change to wild pop-African. Background abruptly becomes surreal, brightly-colored cartoon style.) “I JUST CAN’T WAIT TO BE KING!” ENSEMBLE HEM. HEM. HEM. YOUNG SIMBA I'M GONNA BE A MIGHTY KING, SO ENEMIES BEWARE! ZAZU I’VE NEVER SEEN A KING OF BEASTS (Plucks Young Simba's hair where the mane would be.) WITH QUITE SO LITTLE HAIR.

YOUNG NALA NO ONE SAYING BE THERE. ZAZU What I meant was... YOUNG SIMBA NO ONE SAYING STOP THAT. ZAZU What you don't realize... YOUNG SIMBA NO ONE SAYING SEE HERE. ZAZU Now see here! YOUNG SIMBA FREE TO RUN AROUND ALL DAY, ZAZU That's definitely out... YOUNG SIMBA FREE TO DO IT ALL MY WAY!

ENSEMBLE HEM. HEM. ZAZU I THINK IT’S TIME THAT YOU AND I ARRANGE A HEART-TO-HEART. YOUNG NALA KINGS DON’T NEED ADVICE FROM LITTLE HORNBILLS FROM A START. ZAZU IF THIS IS WHERE THE MONARCHY IS HEADED, COUNT ME OUT. OUT OF SERVICE, OUT OF AFRICA, I WOULDN’T HANG ABOUT. THIS CHILD IS GETTING WILDLY OUT OF WING. YOUNG SIMBA (Cubs trot down a corridor of animals standing at attention; when Zazu follows they all turn their backs while Zazu covers himself with a wing.) OH, I JUST CAN’T WAIT TO BE KING! ENSEMBLE AYE, AYE AYE, AYE YOUNG SIMBA EVERYBODY LOOK LEFT. YOUNG NALA EVERYBODY LOOK RIGHT. YOUNG SIMBA EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK, I’M... YOUNG SIMBA AND YOUNG NALA STANDING IN THE SPOTLIGHT. ZAZU (Speaking strictly this time.) Not yet!

(The group starts going forward while Pride Rock turns into the elephant graveyard.) YOUNG SIMBA, YOUNG NALA, AND ENSEMBLE LET EVERY CREATURE GO FOR BROKE AND SING. LET’S HEAR IT IN THE HERD AND ON THE WING. IT’S GONNA BE KING SIMBA’S FINEST FLING. YOUNG SIMBA OH, I JUST CAN’T WAIT TO BE KING! YOUNG NALA OH, HE JUST CAN’T WAIT TO BE KING! YOUNG SIMBA OH I JUST CAN’T WAIT... YOUNG NALA JUST CAN’T WAIT... YOUNG SIMBA, YOUNG NALA, AND ENSEMBLE TO BE KING! (Zazu is taken away by departing animals while Young Simba and Young Nala remain laughing.)

BLACKOUT

SCENE 6 ELEPHANT GRAVEYARD

YOUNG SIMBA All right, it worked! YOUNG NALA We lost 'im. YOUNG SIMBA (Arrogantly.) I... am a genius! YOUNG NALA Hey, Genius, it was my idea. YOUNG SIMBA Yeah, but I pulled it off. YOUNG NALA With me! YOUNG SIMBA Oh yeah? ...Rrarr! (Young Simba jumps at Young Nala, but Young Nala seemingly pins him down.) YOUNG NALA Ha! Pinned ya! YOUNG SIMBA (Annoyed) Hey, lemme up! (Young Nala turns away smiling. Young Simba looks at her and jumps at her again, and Young Nala ends up pinning Young Simba this time in the elephant graveyard a dark grayish scene filled with elephant skeletons. Eerie music.) YOUNG NALA Pinned ya again. YOUNG SIMBA This is it! We made it!

YOUNG SIMBA AND YOUNG NALA Whoa! YOUNG NALA It's really creepy. YOUNG SIMBA Yeah... Isn't it great? YOUNG NALA (Relishing her naughtiness.) We could get in big trouble. YOUNG SIMBA (Enjoying it also.) I know, huh. YOUNG NALA (Looking at the skull.) I wonder if its brains are still in there. YOUNG SIMBA (Walking towards the skull.) There's only one way to know. Come on. Let's go check it out. (Young Simba walks towards the mouth of the skull. Zazu flaps suddenly up in front of them, emitting a sharp squawk of "Wrong!" and giving the audience a start.) ZAZU The only checking out you will do, will be to check out of here! YOUNG SIMBA Aw, man. ZAZU We're way beyond the boundary of the Pride Lands. YOUNG SIMBA Huh. Look. Banana Beak is scared. Heh. ZAZU (Poking Young Simba on the nose.) That's Mr. Banana Beak to you, fuzzy. And right now we are all in very real danger. (Young Simba has moved nearer to the entrance of the skull.)

YOUNG SIMBA Danger? Hah! I walk on the wild side. I laugh in the face of danger. Ha, ha, ha, ha! (Following Young Simba's confident laughter we hear more laughing from inside the skull. Young Simba runs back and hides behind Young Nala and Zazu. Three hyenas emerge from the skull's eyes and mouth.) SHENZI Well, well, well, Banzai. What have we got here? BANZAI Hmm. I don't know, Shenzi. Uh... what do you think, Ed? ED (Crazy laughter.) (They circle around the cubs and Zazu.) BANZAI Yeah, just what I was thinking. A trio of trespassers! ZAZU And quite by accident, let me assure you. A simple navigational error. Eh, heh, heh... SHENZI Whoa, whoa, wait wait wait... I know you. (Peering closely at Zazu.) You're Mufasa's little stooge. ZAZU I, Madam, am the king's majordomo. BANZAI (Looking at Simba.) And that would make you...? YOUNG SIMBA The future King. SHENZI Do you know what we do to Kings who step out of their kingdom? YOUNG SIMBA Puh. You can't do anything to me.

ZAZU Uhh... technically, they can. We are on their land. YOUNG SIMBA But Zazu, you told me they're nothing but slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers. ZAZU: (Aside, surreptitiously, to Simba.) Ix-nay on the oopid-stay... BANZAI Who you callin' "oopid-stay?!?" “CHOW DOWN” BANZAI HE CALLED US SLOBBERING! SHENZI SAID WE WERE MANGY! BANZAI DID I HEAR STUPID? ED Huh? SHENZI AND BANZAI TELL US AGAIN, GEE... BANZAI IT’S SO INCREDIBLE SHENZI THAT YOU’RE SO RUDE BANZAI WHEN YOU’RE SO EDIBLE, SHENZI AND BANZAI WHEN YOU ARE FOOD! ZAZU (Harried.) My, my, my. Look at the sun. (Starts to try to hasten the cubs away.) It's time to go!

SHENZI What's the hurry? We'd looove you to stick around for dinner. BANZAI Yeaaaah! We could have whatever's... "lion" around! (In the background.) Get it? "Lion" around! (Laughs.) SHENZI Oh wait, wait, wait! I got one, I got one! Make mine a "cub" sandwich. Whatcha think? (They all laugh hysterically.) BANZAI Yeah! And how about a bird “empanada” to teach that feather thing a lesson! (Scar appears looking down on the whole scene.) BANZAI It's time to chow down. SHENZI AND BANZAI CHOW DOWN! CH-CH-CH-CH-CH-CHOW DOWN SHENZI I'’M CHOMPIN’ AT THE BIT, BABY. BANZAI MY STOMACH’S ON THE GROWL, SON. SHENZI AND BANZAI CHOW DOWN! CHOW DOWN! YOU BOTH BEEN INVITED ON A DATE. TWO COURSES HANDED TO US ON A PLAT.E WE’LL HAVE YOU RAW, WON’T BE LONG TO WAIT SEEING YOU’RE ALREADY TOASTED BROWN CHOW DOWN! CH-CH-CH-CH-CH-CHOW DOWN! BANZAI YOUR RIBS ARE LOOKING SO TASTY.

SHENZI SUCH CHEWY LITTLE CHOPS, CHUMS. SHENZI AND BANZAI EAT UP! SHENZI NOW WASN’T IT HER MOM THAT ATE YOUR DAD? SHENZI AND BANZAI AND HAVING PARENTS EATEN MAKES US MAD. WE’RE GONNA SETTLE UP THE SCORE A TAD. WE’VE NEVER HAD A SNACK OF SUCH RENOWN CHOW DOWN! CH-CH-CH-CH-CH-CHHOW DOWN! ED (Peals of uncontrollable laughter. He jumps up and starts gesticulating and jabbering.) Uh-uhuh-uh-uh! SHENZI What, Ed? What is it? BANZAI (Looking where Ed is pointing.) Hey, did we order this dinner to go? SHENZI No. BANZAI Well, there it goes! SHENZI AND BANZAI I THINK WE SHOULD BEGIN THE MEAL FROM SCRATCH. SO MANY JUICY SEGMENTS TO DETACH. BE GOOD AS GOLD FOR YOU’RE AS GOOD AS CARVED. SHENZI Here, kitty kitty, kitty... (Ed and Banzai giggle.)

SHENZI AND BANZAI We're starved! (Shenzi and Banzai grab Zazu.) BANZAI The little majordomo bird hippity-hopped! ZAZU Help! YOUNG SIMBA (Now near the hyenas.) Hey! Why don't you pick on somebody your own size? SHENZI Like... you? YOUNG SIMBA Oops. SHENZI Look, boys! A king fit for a meal! SHENZI, BANZAI, ED Boo! (Laughter.) (Young Simba claws Shenzi across the cheek and tries to roar. He produces a nice medium yowl.) YOUNG SIMBA Rrarr! SHENZI Oo-hoo... that was it? Hah. Do it again... come on. (Young Simba opens his mouth to roar again, but we hear a full- grown lion roar.) SHENZI, BANZAI, ED Huh?! (Mufasa charges the hyenas until they are cringing under him.)

SHENZI Oh, please, please! Uncle! Uncle! BANZAI Ow! Ow! Ow! MUFASA (Half roar.) Silence! BANZAI Oh, we're gonna shut up right now! SHENZI Calm down. We're really sorry. MUFASA If you ever come near my son again... SHENZI Oh, this is... this is your son?!? BANZAI Oh, your son? SHENZI Did you know that? BANZAI No... me? I-I-I didn't know it. No. Did you? SHENZI No! Of course not. BANZAI No. SHENZI AND BANZAI Ed? ED (Stupidly nods yes.) (Mufasa roars.)

BANZAI Toodles! (With a gunshot sound they disappear.)

(Segue into next scene.) END OF SCENE 6

SCENE 7 THE GORGE (While the lions and Zazu walk front stage out of the burial grounds, the back becomes the Pride Lands in the starry night time. The cubs move bent down with shame. Zazu lights in front of Mufasa, giving him a "that'll show 'em" nod... but then withers under Mufasa's angry glare.) YOUNG SIMBA (Approaching his father.) Dad, I... MUFASA You deliberately disobeyed me. YOUNG SIMBA Dad, I'm... I'm sorry. MUFASA (Stern.) Let's go home. YOUNG NALA (Whispering.) I thought you were very brave. (The cubs are still walking in a shamed manner behind Mufasa. Zazu is flying between.) MUFASA (Still stern.) Zazu? ZAZU (Flying forward and lighting in front of Mufasa, his trepidation showing.) Yes, Sire? MUFASA (Stern.) Take Nala home. I've got to teach my son a lesson. (Young Simba crouches lower in the grass as if to hide. Zazu flies back to the cubs.) ZAZU Come, Nala. Simba... (Puts his wings on Simba's shoulders, gives a heavy sigh, and then a reassuring pat.) Good luck. (Zazu and Young Nala leave.)

MUFASA (Calling, still very stern, not looking at Young Simba.) Simba! (The word reverberates in the night air.) (Young Simba slowly turns and walks towards his father. Ominous yet sad music. Simba steps into a depression. Looking down he sees that his forepaw fits inside just the palmprint of his father's paw. A very tense moment for Simba. It comes across to the audience that his father could easily do much, much more than discipline Young Simba. It also comes across that Young Simba has some rather big shoes to fill, so to speak, and is only now realizing his true position. Young Simba is harshly reminded of how small and young he is compared to his father. He looks up and, quite courageously, continues to come forward. Mufasa thinks silently for a few moments, not looking at his son. Then, finally, he turns to him.) MUFASA Simba, I'm very disappointed in you. YOUNG SIMBA (Very quietly and sadly.) I know. MUFASA (Continuing.) You could have been killed. You deliberately disobeyed me. And what's worse, you put Nala in danger! YOUNG SIMBA (Bordering on crying, voice cracks.) I was just trying to be brave like you. MUFASA I'm only brave when I have to be. Simba... being brave doesn't mean you go looking for trouble. YOUNG SIMBA But you're not scared of anything. MUFASA I was today. YOUNG SIMBA (Disbelieving.) You were?

MUFASA Yes... (Bends down close to Young Simba.) I thought I might lose you. YOUNG SIMBA Oh. (Lightening slightly.) I guess even Kings get scared, huh? MUFASA Mm-hmm. YOUNG SIMBA (Whispering conspiratorially.) But you know what? MUFASA (Whispering back.) What? YOUNG SIMBA I think those hyenas were even scareder. MUFASA (Gentle laugh.) 'Cause nobody messes with your dad. Come here, you. (Mufasa has bent down. He picks Young Simba up and starts giving him a noogie.) YOUNG SIMBA Oh no, no... Aaagh! Errrggh! (Music rises as Young Simba and Mufasa tussle playfully for a brief while.) YOUNG SIMBA Oh, come here... (As Mufasa runs away.) Hah! Gotcha! (They end up with Mufasa laid down and Young Simba on his head.) YOUNG SIMBA Dad? MUFASA Hmm?

YOUNG SIMBA We're pals, right? MUFASA (Gentle laugh.) Right. YOUNG SIMBA And we'll always be together, right? Mufasa: (Sitting up, Young Simba now on his shoulder.) Simba... Let me tell you something that my father told me... Look at the stars. The great Kings of the past who are connected to us and look down on us look from those stars. YOUNG SIMBA (Awed.) Really? MUFASA Yes... So whenever you feel alone, just remember that those Kings will always be there to guide you... And so will I. “THEY LIVE IN YOU” ENSMEBLE INGONYAMA NENGW' ENAMABALA INGONYAMA NENGW’ ENAMABALA MUFASA NIGHT AND THE SPIRIT OF LIFE... CALLING MAMELA. AND A VOICE, WITH THE FEAR OF A CHILD...

BLACKOUT

SCENE 8 ELEPHANT GRAVEYARD (We see the three leading hyenas having a prívate talk unaware of Scar’s presence.) BANZAI Man, that lousy Mufasa! I won't be able to sit for a week! (We notice numerous scratches on Banzai's rear.) ED (Laughs.) BANZAI It's not funny, Ed. ED (Tries to stop laughing, but bursts out worse.) BANZAI Hey, shut up, you coward! ED (Cannot stop laughing. Banzai tackles Ed; they start fighting.) SHENZI Will you knock it off! (Banzai stops. Ed continues, biting himself in the leg.) BANZAI Well, he started it! SHENZI Look at you losers. No wonder we're dangling at the bottom of the food chain. BANZAI (With drool dangling from his mouth.) Man, I hate dangling. SHENZI Shyeah? You know, if it weren't for those lions, we'd be runnin' the joint. BANZAI

Yeah. Man, I hate lions. SHENZI So pushy. BANZAI And hairy. SHENZI And stinky. BANZAI And man, are they... SHENZI AND BANZAI Uuuugly ! (Laughter.) SCAR (From his perch.) Oh, surely we lions are not all that bad. BANZAI Ohh. (Relieved from the surprise.) Oh, Scar, it's just you. SHENZI We was afraid it was somebody important. BANZAI Yeah, you know, like Mufasa. SHENZI Yeah. SCAR I see. BANZAI Now that's power! SHENZI Tell me about it! I just hear that name and I-I-I-I-I shu-dder!

BANZAI Mu-fasa! SHENZI (Shivering.) Ooooh. ... Do it again! BANZAI Mu-fasa! SHENZI Ooooh! BANZAI Mufasa! Mufasa! Mufasa! SHENZI (Builds up hysterical laughter.) ...Oooh! It tingles me. SCAR I'm surrounded by idiots. BANZAI Not you, Scar; I mean, you're one of us. I mean, you're our pal. SCAR (Sarcastic.) Charmed. SHENZI Ohh, I like that. He's not king, but he's still sooo proper. BANZAI Yeah. Hey, hey! Did ya bring us anything to eat, Scar, old buddy, old pal? Huh? Did-ya-did-yadid-ya? SCAR I don't think you really deserve this. (Holds out a zebra haunch.) I practically gift- wrapped those cubs for you. (Drops leg to hyenas.) And you couldn't even dispose of them. SHENZI (Chewing with full mouth.)Well, ya know. It wasn't exactly like they was alone, Scar. BANZAI Yeah. What are we supposed to do? (Swallow.) Kill Mufasa?

SCAR Precisely. (The three hyenas pause from eating and look up at Scar questioningly.) (Scar's leaps down to the hyenas.) “BE PREPARED!” SCAR I NEVER THOUGHT HYENAS ESSENTIAL. THEY’RE CRUDE AND UNSPEAKABLY PLAIN. BUT MAYBE THEY’VE A GLIMMER OF POTENTIAL IF ALLIED TO MY VISION AND BRAIN. (Scar paces slowly around Ed, who is chewing on the remnants of the zebra leg.) CHORUS HEM, HEM, HEM, HEM. SCAR I KNOW THAT YOUR POWERS OF RETENTION ARE AS WET AS A WARTHOG’S BACKSIDE. BUT THICK AS YOU ARE, PAY ATTENTION! (He angrily swats the bone away; Ed comes to abrupt attention.) MY WORDS ARE A MATTER OF PRIDE. IT’S CLEAR FROM YOUR VACANT EXPRESSIONS THE LIGHTS ARE NOT ALL ON UPSTAIRS. (Waving his paw in front of Ed's blank eyes to make his point; Ed's tongue lolls out.) BUT WE’RE TALKING KINGS AND SUCCESSIONS. (Shenzi and Banzai are laughing on a ledge behind him; on "you," Scar turns and leaps at them, making them jump into the air.) EVEN YOU CAN’T BE CAUGHT UNAWARES. (In the next verse, Scar is strutting theatrically.) SO PREPARE FOR THE CHANCE OF A LIFETIME. BE PREPARED FOR SENSATIONAL NEWS. A SHINING NEW ERA

IS TIPTOEING NEARER. SHENZI AND WHERE DO WE FEATURE? SCAR (Grabbing Shenzi's cheek.) JUST LISTEN TO TEACHER (Shenzi rubs her cheek.) I KNOW IT SOUNDS SORDID, BUT YOU’LL BE REWARDED WHEN AT LAST I AM GIVEN MY DUES! AND INJUSTICE DELICIOUSLY SQUARED, (Scar leaps up beside Ed, who is again chewing on the bone, and here kicks him off.) SCAR AND HYENAS BE PREPARED! (The three hyenas land in a pile of bones and are submerged; they reappear, each with a different horned skull on his head.) BANZAI Yeah, be prepared. Yeah-heh... we'll be prepared, heh. ...For what? SCAR For the death of the King. BANZAI Why? Is he sick? (Scar grabs Banzai by the throat.) SCAR No, fool... we're going to kill him. And Simba too. (Letting go of Banzai.) SHENZI Great idea! Who needs a King? SHENZI AND BANZAI: (Sing-song voices, dancing around Ed.) No King! No King! La-lala-la-laa-laa!

SCAR Idiots! There will be a King! BANZAI Hey, but you said, uh... SCAR I will be King! ...Stick with me (triumphant, toothy grin), and you'll never go hungry again! SHENZI AND BANZAI Yaay! All right! Long live the King! (Many hyenas appear in the shadows.) ALL HYENAS Long live the King! Long live the King! (Scar's army of hyenas is goose-stepping across the floor of the cave, now stylized into a Nazi-esque quadrangle.) HYENAS (In tight, crisp phrasing diction.) IT’S GREAT THAT WE’LL SOON BE CONNECTED WITH A KING WHO’LL BE ALL-TIME ADORED. SCAR OF COURSE, QUID PRO QUO, YOU’RE EXPECTED TO TAKE CERTAIN DUTIES ON BOARD. (Motions a slice across the neck.) THE FUTURE IS LITTERED WITH PRIZES. AND THOUGH I’M THE MAIN ADDRESSEE, THE POINT THAT I MUST EMPHASIZE IS: (Leaps off his rock throne to single out one hapless hyena.) YOU WON’T GET A SNIFF WITHOUT ME! (That hyena scuddles away. Throughout the next verse, the entire horde of hyenas joins in dancing boisterously, leaping along the tops of rock pillars, shaking animal skeletons in the light, one playing a rib cage/xylophone. They all move front stage to change the scenery for the gorge.)

SCAR AND HYENAS SO PREPARE FOR THE COUP OF THE CENTURY. SCAR BE PREPARED FOR THE MURKIEST SCAM! METICULOUS PLANNING, TENACITY SPANNING, DECADES OF DENIAL, IS SIMPLY WHY I’LL SCAR BE KING UNDISPUTED. RESPECTED, SALUTED, AND SEEN FOR THE WONDER I AM. YES, MY TEETH AND AMBITIONS ARE BARED. SCAR AND HYENAS (Even Ed, who can be heard growling and snarling an approximation of the lines.) BE PREPARED! YES, OUR TEETH AND AMBITIONS ARE BARED. BE PREPARED! (Scar and the hyenas are laughing evilly. Drum roll rises to a crash coinciding with the beginning of the next scene.) HYENAS OOOOOO, LA-LA-LA! WE’LL HAVE FOOD! LOTS OF FOOD1 WE REPEAT: ENDLESS MEAT.

BLACKOUT

SCENE 9 THE GORGE SCAR Now you wait here. Your father has a marvelous surprise for you. YOUNG SIMBA Oooh! What is it? SCAR If I told you, it wouldn't be a surprise, now would it? YOUNG SIMBA If you tell me, I'll still act surprised. SCAR Ho, ho, ho. You are such a naughty boy. YOUNG SIMBA Come on, Uncle Scar. SCAR No-no-no-no-no-no-no. This is just for you and your daddy. You know, a sort of... father-son... thing. (Through Simba's expression, we see that he resents Scar's dismissive attitude, but soon shrugs it off.) SCAR Well! I'd better go get him. YOUNG SIMBA I'll go with you. SCAR (Loud, snapping tone.) No! (Regaining composure.) Heh, heh, heh. No. Just stay right here. You wouldn't want to end up in another mess like you did with the hyenas... YOUNG SIMBA (Shocked.) You know about that? SCAR Simba, everybody knows about that.

YOUNG SIMBA (Meek and embarrassed.) Really? SCAR Oh, yes. Lucky Daddy was there to save you, eh? (Clearly enjoying himself; he puts a paw on Young Simba's shoulder.) Oh... and just between us, you might want to work on that little roar of yours. Hmm? (Scar starts to pull away.) YOUNG SIMBA Oh... Okay... (Scar pats Young Simba roughly on the head, then moves off.) YOUNG SIMBA Hey, Uncle Scar, will I like the surprise? SCAR (Turning back over his shoulder.) Simba, it's to die for. (The spot light shines on the hyenas Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed that are hidden under a rock arch high up behind a herd of wildebeest.) BANZAI (Stomach growls.) SHENZI Shut up. BANZAI I can't help it! I'm sooo hungry... (Jumping up.) I gotta have a wildebeest! SHENZI Stay put! BANZAI Well... can't I just pick off one of the little sick ones? SHENZI No! We wait for the signal from Scar. (The other spotlight shines on Scar that has mounted on a rock in view of the hyenas.)

SHENZI There he is... (Making an evil, almost humorous face.) Let's go. (Spot light switches back to Simba.) YOUNG SIMBA Little roar. Puh! (Simba attempts roaring, each time louder.) Rarrr! ...Rrrraowr-nh! (For the third attempt, Simba moves closer again and inhales deeply.) ...Raowr! (Louder.) (Simba's roar echoes around the canyon. Simba relishes the echo. The echo is soon eclipsed, however, by a low rumble. Terrified Simba takes off in front of the herd.) “THE STAMPEDE” (We see the herd coming over the gorge. Simba takes off in front of the herd with a terrified face.) (In a small section of the Pride Lands at a distance from the canyon are Mufasa and Zazu.) ZAZU Oh look, Sire; the herd is on the move. MUFASA Odd... (Scar runs up to them, out of breath.) SCAR Mufasa! Quick! Stampede! In the gorge! Simba's out there! MUFASA Simba?!! (Zazu reaches first and he spots Young Simba.) YOUNG SIMBA Zazu! Help me!! ZAZU Your father is on the way! Hold on! YOUNG SIMBA Hurry!

(Mufasa and Scar are on the lower ledges of the gorge. Zazu points out to them where Young Simba is.) ZAZU There! There! MUFASA I’m coming, Simba! YOUNG SIMBA Ahhhh! (Mufasa runs out into the herd, joining the stampede.) ZAZU Oh Scar, this is awful! What will we do? What will we do? Hah ... I'll go back for help, that's what I'll do, I'll go back for he... oomph! (Scar backhands Zazu into a rock wall, knocking him out. Scar then follows Mufasa's progress from the lip of the gorge, his shadow cast mysteriously from the bottom of the gully. Mufasa reaches Young Simba and sets him on a ledge but falls back into the gorge where he is hidden behind a row of trampling wildebeest.) YOUNG SIMBA Dad! (Young Simba watches in horror as he cannot find his father in the swirling mass of wildebeest below him. At the last second, Mufasa leaps out of the herd and starts to climb with great difficulty up the sheer rock slope. Young Simba turns and starts to climb up to the top of the gorge. Out of Young Simba's sight, Mufasa reaches a point right below a ledge where he can't climb due to the steepness. His claws are scraping and his back paws have no traction. Above him on the ledge is Scar.) MUFASA Scar! Broth... (Slips, barely hangs on.) Brother! Help me! (Scar looks disdainfully down, and then suddenly latches onto Mufasa's forepaws with claws extended. Mufasa roars, primarily from the sudden pain of Scar's claws, but no doubt also due to the sudden flash of realization. His

expression slowly changes to one of horror as he recognizes Scar's intent.)

SCAR (Slowly and evilly.) Long live the King! (Scar throws his brother backwards and Mufasa falls in the midst of the wildebeest.) MUFASA Aaaaaaahh! (Mufasa and Young Simba's screams mingle.) YOUNG SIMBA Nooooooo! (The herd passes. Everything is clouded by dust. Young Simba bounds to the canyon floor. Mufasa is nowhere to be seen.) YOUNG SIMBA (Cough.) Dad!! (Quietly.) Dad? (Mufasa, laying on his side. He is not moving or breathing. Young Simba approaches the body. Sad musical theme. Again we notice how small Young Simba really is.) YOUNG SIMBA (Hopefully.) Dad? ...Dad, come on! (He rubs up against Mufasa's cheek. The head merely rolls back in place after the rub.) You gotta get up! (He places both forepaws on his father's cheek and pushes.) Dad! We gotta go home! (He tugs at Mufasa. Again Mufasa’s body limply moves back in place. Young Simba runs off a bit, obviously very scared.) Heeeeelp! Somebody! (His voice reverberates hollowly off the sides of the gorge.) Anybody... help. (He cries. Young Simba turns back to the body. He nuzzles up and embraces him. Pause for effect. Then we see Scar appearing through the dust.) SCAR Simba. ...What have you done?!

YOUNG SIMBA (Jumps back, crying.) There were wildebeests and he tried to save me... it was an accident, I... I didn't mean for it to happen. SCAR (Embracing Young Simba, yet still distant.) Of course, of course you didn't. No one... ever means (pulls Young Simba closer; Young Simba hides his face on Scar's foreleg) ...for these things to happen. But the King is dead. (Looking with mock regret at Young Simba.) And if it weren't for you, he'd still be alive. (Young Simba is crushed, believing his guilt. Another thought "occurs" to Scar.) Oh! What will your mother think? YOUNG SIMBA (Sniffing.) What am I gonna do?! SCAR Run away, Simba. Run... Run away and never return. (Young Simba runs off blindly, obviously broken. Slight pause, for the audience to catch its emotional breath. Music ends. The three hyenas appear behind Scar.) SCAR Kill him. (The hyenas take off after him; Scar initially stands motionless. The hyenas move forward.) BANZAI Whoa!! Where is he? SHENZI Hey... There he goes! There he goes! BANZAI So go get 'im. SHENZI Into the desert? Are you nuts? Ain't no way I'm going there. BANZAI We gotta finish the job. What if Scar finds out?

SHENZI He won’t, unless you open up your big snout. Anyway, he's as good as dead out there. And if he comes back, we'll kill him. BANZAI (Shouting.) Yeah! You hear that? If you ever come back, we'll kill ya!!! ("Kill ya" echoes off as we see Simba still running into the desert. The hyenas make their way off the cliffs back to the Pride Lands.)

Some of them, with Zazu, are comforting Sarabi, who bends her head in extreme pain. Young Nala is close to her mother, crying.) SCAR ...For me it is a deep personal loss. So it is with a heavy heart that I assume the throne. Yet, out of the ashes of this tragedy, we shall rise to greet the dawning of a new era... (The hyenas start emerging, casting eerie green shadows and laughing hollowly.) ...in which lion and hyena come together, in a great and glorious future!

SCENE 11 THE DESERT - THE JUNGLE (Young Simba is lying out in the hot desert sun. Buzzards are circling the cub's body. With a blast of music, Timon and Pumbaa appear and dive into the midst of the buzzards. They slap and kick the buzzards all away.) TIMON Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaahh! Get out! Get out! Get Outta here! Whoo! PUMBAA I love it! Bowling for buzzards! TIMON (Laughing, dusting himself off.) Gets 'em every time. PUMBAA (Looking at Young Simba.) Uh-oh. Hey Timon. You better come look. I think it's still alive. TIMON Ewww... (Timon walks to the front of Simba. He is lying with his paw over his face.) TIMON All righty, what have we got here? (He smells Young Simba. With a great effort he lifts Young Simba's paw that is covering his face and jumps back, terrified.) TIMON Jeez, it's a lion! (Jumping up on Pumbaa.) Run, Pumbaa! Move it! PUMBAA Hey, Timon. It's just a little lion. Look at him. He's so cute, and all alone! Can we keep him? TIMON (Yelling into Pumbaa's ear, which creates a reverberating effect.) Pumbaa, are you nuts?! We're talking about a lion. Lions eat guys like us!

PUMBAA But he's so little. (He leans over to regard Young Simba.) TIMON He's gonna get biggeeer. PUMBAA But maybe he'll be on our side. TIMON Ahuh! That's the stupidest thing I ever heard! Maybe he'll b... ...Hey, I got it! What if he's on our side?! You know, having a lion around might not be such a bad idea. PUMBAA So we keeping 'im? TIMON Of course. Who's the brains in this outfit? PUMBAA Uhhh... TIMON My point exactly. Jeez, I'm fried! Let's get out of here and find some shade. (Following Timon, Pumbaa carries Young Simba into the shaded jungle.They fan Young Simba and he stirs.) TIMON You okay, kid? YOUNG SIMBA I guess so. PUMBAA You nearly died. TIMON I saved you. (Pumbaa snorts at Timon.) TIMON Well, uh, Pumbaa helped. A little.

YOUNG SIMBA (Dully.) Thanks for your help. (Young Simba heads off quietly back out towards the desert.) TIMON Hey, where you going? YOUNG SIMBA Nowhere. TIMON (Watching Young Simba, talking to Pumbaa.) Gee. He looks blue. PUMBAA I'd say... brownish-gold. TIMON No, no, no, no! I mean, he's depressed. PUMBAA Oh. (Pumbaa trots up to Young Simba.) Hey kid, what's eatin' ya? TIMON Nothing; he's at the top of the food chain! Ahhhhhhha ha haaa! The food cha- haain! (Pumbaa and Simba stare at him silently.) Ha ha hum... ahem. (Realizing his joke flopped.) So, where you from...? YOUNG SIMBA Who cares? I can't go back. TIMON Ahh. You're an outcast! That's great, so are we. PUMBAA What'cha do, kid? YOUNG SIMBA Something terrible. But I don't wanna talk about it. TIMON Good. We don't wanna hear about it.

PUMBAA (To Timon.) Come on, Timon. (To Young Simba.) Anything we can do? YOUNG SIMBA Not unless you can change the past. PUMBAA You know, kid, in times like this my buddy Timon here says, "You got to put your behind in your past..." TIMON (Waving arms.) No. No. Nooo! PUMBAA I mean... TIMON Amateur! Lie down before you hurt yourself. (To Young Simba.) It's: "You got to put your past behind you." Look, kid. Bad things happen, and you can't do anything about it, right? YOUNG SIMBA Right. TIMON (Pokes Young Simba's nose.) Wrong! When the world turns its back on you, you turn your back on the world. YOUNG SIMBA Well, that's not what I was taught. TIMON Then maybe you need a new lesson. Repeat after me. (Clears throat.) Hakuna MATATA. Simba: (Still lethargic.) What? PUMBAA Ha-ku-na Ma-ta-ta. It means: "No worries." “HAKUNA MATATA” (No fade in except in marimba chords.)

TIMON HAKUNA MATATA! WHAT A WONDERFUL PHRASE! PUMBAA HAKUNA MATATA! AIN’T NO PASSING CRAZE. TIMON IT MEANS NO WORRIES FOR THE REST OF YOUR DAYS. (Timon pulls Young Simba over to a green bush and leans him back on it.) TIMON AND PUMBAA IT’S OUR PROBLEM-FREE PHILOSOPHY, TIMON (Filing down one of Young Simba's claws.) HAKUNA MATATA! YOUNG SIMBA Hakuna Matata? PUMBAA Yeah. It's our motto! YOUNG SIMBA What's a motto? TIMON Nothin’. What's a-motto with you? Ah, ha, ha, ha... PUMBAA (Laughing.) You know now, kid. Those two words will solve all your problems. TIMON That's right. Take Pumbaa here... Why, WHEN HE WAS A YOUNG WARTHOG... PUMBAA (Italian counter tenor range.) WHEN I WAS A YOUNG WARTHOG!

TIMON Very nice. PUMBAA Thanks. TIMON HE FOUND HIS AROMA LACKED A CERTAIN APPEAL. HE COULD CLEAR THE SAVANNAH AFTER EVERY MEAL. PUMBAA I’M A SENSITIVE SOULD THOUGH I SEEM THICK-SKINNED. AND IT HURT THAT MY FRIENDS NEVER STOOD DOWNWIND! AND OH, THE SHAME! TIMON He was ashamed! PUMBAA THOUGHT OF CHANGIN' MY NAME! TIMON Oh, what’s in a name? PUMBAA AND I GOT DOWNHEARTED TIMON How did ya feel? EVERYTIME THAT I... TIMON Hey, Pumbaa! Not in front of the kids! PUMBAA Oh... sorry. (String pizzicato. Simba looks with growing interest and surprised.) TIMON AND PUMBAA HAKUNA MATATA! WHAT A WONDERFUL PHRASE!

HAKUNA MATATA! AIN’T NO PASSING CRAZE! YOUNG SIMBA (After becoming more and more enthusiastic, he finally joins in singing, a spotlight falling on him.) IT MEANS NO WORRIES FOR THE REST OF YOUR DAYS. (Timon does a vaudeville knee-slide up to Simba.) TIMON Sing it, kid! Timon, Pumbaa, and Young Simba IT’S OUR PROBLEM-FREE PHILOSOPHY. HAKUNA MATATA! (Timon pulls back a fern leaf, revealing a beautiful view of a rift-jungle. Waterfalls and rugged terrain make a beautiful view. Harp runs accentuate the scene.) TIMON Welcome... to our humble home. YOUNG SIMBA You live here? TIMON We live wherever we want. PUMBAA Yep. Home is where your rump rests. Heh! YOUNG SIMBA It's beautiful. PUMBAA (Loud raunchy belch.) I'm starved. YOUNG SIMBA I'm so hungry I could eat a whole zebra. (Timon is rather disturbed by Young Simba's want for meat... a little bit taken aback and a little bit I-knew-this-would-happen.)

TIMON Eeeahhah... We're fresh out of zebra. YOUNG SIMBA Any antelope? TIMON Nah. YOUNG SIMBA (A bit desperate.) Hippo? TIMON Nope. Listen, kid; if you live with us, you have to eat like us. Hey, this looks like a good spot to rustle up some grub. (Timon has stopped in front of a log. Pumbaa forces it up with his snout, revealing many insects. Timon picks one up.) YOUNG SIMBA Eeew! What's that? TIMON A grub. What's it look like? YOUNG SIMBA Eeew! Gross! TIMON (Eating, mouth full.) Mmmm. Tastes like chicken. (Pumbaa slurps up a large worm from the ground. Both Timon and Pumbaa are feasting on bugs by now.) PUMBAA (Slurping.) Slimy, yet satisfying. TIMON (Grabbing a bug.) These are rare delicacies. Mmmm. (Crunches.) Piquant, with a very pleasant crunch. PUMBAA You'll learn to love 'em.

TIMON I'm telling you, kid, this is the great life. No rules. No responsibilities. (Pokes his hand into a knothole and many bugs scramble out.) Oooh! The little cream-filled kind. (Munch.) And best of all, no worries. (Timon has been collecting bugs on a leaf. He offers it to Simba. Simba picks out a grub.) TIMON Well, kid? YOUNG SIMBA Oh well... Hakuna Matata. (He eats. Sick music.) YOUNG SIMBA (Looking more cheerful.) Slimy, yet satisfying. TIMON That's it! (The scene switches to all three crossing a log, walking and tossing their heads to the music. With a steady build in the music, a change occurs. As they cross the log in the opposite direction young Simba has become an adult.)

SCENE 1 PRIDE LANDS (Now we are in Pride Lands. The landscape is grayish, barren. There are animal skeletons and the birds have been replaced by vultures.) SCAR Zazu, why am I not loved? “THE MADNESS OF KING SCAR” SCAR (CONT’D) I AM THAT RARE AND AWESOME THING. I'M EVERY INCH A KING. YET I FEEL A TWINGE OF DOUBT AS I GO WALK ABOUT. BANZAI Hey, boss! SCAR WHEN MY NAME IS WHISPERED THROUGH THE PRIDE, IS THIS TALK OF LOVE OR REGICIDE? SHENZI Reggie who? SCAR TELL ME I’M ADORED. PLEASE TELL ME I’M ADORED. BANZAI Hey, boss! SCAR (Exasperated.) Oooh, what is it? BANZAI We got a bone to pick with you.

SHENZI There's no food, no water... BANZAI Yeah. It's dinnertime, and there ain't no stinkin' entrées! SCAR Oh, you and your petty complaints! You don't know what real hunger is. Day after day it gnaws at the very core of my being. BANZAI I had that once. It was worms. (pronounced woims.) SCAR No, no, no. It's like an itch. Deep, persistent, profound... BANZAI That's it... worms! (woims) When they get really bad all you gotta do is... hunker down and scoot! (The hyenas laugh.) SCAR Thanks for the tip. Ingrates! If it weren't for me you'd be beating off buzzards for your next bite! SHENZI AND BANZAI YEAH, YOU’RE OUR SAVIOR, THANKS A BUNCH. BUT HOW ABOUT SOME LUNCH? IT DOESN’T MATTER IF IT’S FRESH I NEED A FIX OF FLESH MY BONES HAVE MOVED TO WHERE THEY’VE NEVER BEEN. THEY ARE ON THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN. ED HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA SCAR Are you blaming me? SHENZI AND BANZAI Oh no, it's the lionesses. ED (opera) AH AH AH AH LA LA LA, LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA AH

SHENZI AND BANZAI YOU ARE SO ADORED. ZAZU YOU. YOU. YOU. YOU YOU. YOU BANZAI YOU ARE SO ADORED SHENZI YOU, YOU, YOU, YOU, YOU.

SHENZI AND BANZAI OH, YOU ARE SO ADORED. SCAR That's more like it! SHENZI AND BANZAI (ED ad lib rhythmic laughing.) BUT WHAT I’D GIVE FOR ONE MORE HIT OF WILDEBEEST KIELBASA OR MAYBE HORNBILL ON THE SPIT. ZAZU Oh, how I miss Mufasa! SCAR (Quick and angry.) Mufasa?! Mufasa?! (Hyenas let out nervous giggles.) How dare you! I told you never to mention that name! ZAZU Note taken. I shall never mention "M-m-m" again. SCAR Even in death, his shadow looms over me... (Lion shadows appear and Scar is terrified.) There he is! No! There he is! And there! ZAZU Calm yourself, Sire, or you'll get another one of your splitting headaches! SCAR I am perfectly fine! I'M BETTER THAN MUFASA WAS.

I'M REVERED, I AM REVILED. I’M IDOLIZED. I AM DESPISED! I'M KEEPING CALM. I’M GOING WILD! I TELL MYSELF I’M FINE. Yes I am, no you're not, Yes I am, no you're not, I TELL MYSELF I’M FINE. No you're not, Yes I am, No you're not, Yes, No, Yes, No, Fine, Not, Am, Not Who am I talking to? Ah, ha, ha, ha... ZAZU Oh, pull yourself together, Sire! SCAR Oh, very well. Zazu? Zazu, Zazu, Zazu...? ZAZU Yes, Sire? SCAR Nobody loved me, there's the rub, not even as a cub. What did my brother have that I don't have? ZAZU Do you want the short list or the long? SCAR Whatever! ZAZU Well, he had adoring subjects... SCAR Nah. ZAZU A loving family... SCAR Nah.

ZAZU A devoted Queen... SCAR That's it! I need a Queen! ZAZU A what?! SCAR A Queen, man! A Queen! Without a Queen, what am I? A dead end, no line, no descendants, no future. With a Queen, I'll have cubs... Immortality will be mine! Immortality will be mine!! (Nala comes in with other lionesses.) NALA Scar. SCAR Ah, Nala... Your timing couldn't have been more perfect. My how you've grown! NALA Scar, you have got to do something... We're being forced to overhunt! SCAR SHE’S GOT THOSE ASSETS FEMININE. NALA You're the King. Control the hyenas! SCAR I HAVE TO MAKE HER MINE. NALA You're destroying the Pride Lands. SCAR NOBILITY IN EVERY GENE NALA If we stop now, don't you see... SCAR SHE HAS TO BE MY QUEEN

NALA ...there's still a chance for things to be all right again... SCAR (Scar tries to seduce Nala.) COME, SWEET NALA IT’S WRITTEN IN THE STARS. NALA What are you doing? Are you listening to me?! SCAR WE’LL CREATE A HOST OF LITTLE SCARS. NALA What are you talking about? SCAR TELL ME I’M ADORED. NALA Get away from me!! SCAR Tell me I'm adore... (Nala scratches Scar.) Ah, Nala... you know how I loathe violence... One way or another, you will be mine! NALA Never, Scar. Never!! SCAR YOU BELONG TO ME. YOU ALL BELONG TO ME! (They hyenas run off; Ed lets loose a crazy laugh. Scar and Zazu also leave while Nala stays in the Pride Lands with other lionesses and chorus members. Rafiki observes all from this tree house.)

SCENE 2 THE JUNGLE (Simba is sleeping in the jungle while the African people begin to sing the song starts gently fading in and ends gently fading out. Pumbaa and eventually Timon also sing. “WEEM-A-WEP” MEN HEM. HEM. HEM. HEM. HEM. HEM. HEM. HEM. MEN PUMBAA HEM. HEM. HEM. HEM. A WEEM-A-WEP, A WEEM-A-WEP (x2) HEM. HEM. HEM. HEM.

I can’t hear you, buddy. Back me up! WEE, A PUMBAA BUM BAWAY. A WEE, A PUMBAA BUM BAWAY. (Timon dances up to wear Simba is sleeping. Pumbaa follows.) TIMON Oh, so there you are! We were looking for you all over the place... (Simba stretches himself and yawns.) TIMON (Grabbing his belly.) Oh, I’m stuffed! PUMBAA Me too. I ate like a pig.

SIMBA (Speaking sleepily.) Pumbaa... you are a pig. PUMBAA Oh. Right. (All three sigh deeply, in unison.) PUMBAA Timon? TIMON Yeah? PUMBAA Ever wonder what those sparkly dots are up there? TIMON Pumbaa. I don't wonder; I know. PUMBAA Oh, really. What are they? TIMON They're fireflies. Fireflies that uh... got stuck up in that big... bluish-black... thing. PUMBAA Oh. Gee. I always thought that they were balls of gas burning billions of miles away. TIMON Pumbaa, wit' you, everything's gas. PUMBAA Simba, what do you think? SIMBA Well, I don't know... PUMBAA Aw come on. Give, give, give... Well, come on, Simba, we told you ours... pleeeease?! TIMON Come on, come on... give, give...

SIMBA (Reluctantly.) Well, somebody once told me that the great Kings of the past are up there, watching over us. PUMBAA (Awed, either genuinely or mockingly.) Really? TIMON You mean a bunch of royal dead guys are watching us? (Tries to keep composure, then... Timon breaks out laughing. Pumbaa joins in. Simba does half-heartedly.) TIMON Who told you something like that? What mook made that up? SIMBA Yeah. Pretty dumb, huh? TIMON Aw, you're killing me, Simba. (The music rises again. Simba looks back up at the stars. He quietly gets up and walks away.) Was it something I said? (Timon and Pumbaa leave.) “ENDLESS NIGHT” (Simba remains with the jungle chorus. While it sings Rafiki in her tree house sniffs something in the air and grunts; she becomes aware that Simba is alive.) RAFIKI Simba? He's... he's alive? He, he... he's alive! In the jungle! (She laughs.) (Rafiki grabs her staff. Laughing in delight, she picks up some paint and puts a mane on the smeared lion image on the wall.) RAFIKI It is time! ENSEMBLE HEM... HEM, HEM... HEM, HEM...

SOPRANOS, ALTOS WEBABA NGIVELELWE SIMBA WHERE HAS THE STARLIGHT GONE? DARK IS THE DAY. HOW CAN I FIND MY WAY HOME? HOME IS AN EMPTY DREAM LOST TO THE NIGHT. FATHER, I FEEL SO ALONE.

(Simba remains with the jungle chorus. While it sings Rafiki in her tree house sniffs something in the air and grunts; she becomes aware that Simba is alive.) RAFIKI Simba? He's... he's alive? He, he... he's alive! In the jungle! (She laughs.) (Rafiki grabs her staff. Laughing in delight, she picks up some paint and puts a mane on the smeared lion image on the wall.) RAFIKI It is time! (It’s daytime in the jungle. Simba is no longer there, but we see Timon coming in looking for Pumbaa.)

TIMON Pumbaa, Pumbaa!! I can't hear you, buddy! A-Pumbaa? Pumbaa? PUMBAA (Off stage you hear a dreadful scream.) Yeeeeaaahhh! (He runs in with the lioness in hot pursuit.) PUMBAA She's gonna eat me!! TIMON (Seeing the lioness.) Whoa! ... Jeez! Why do I always have to save your aaaaaa! (Simba plunges in defending his friends.On the aaaaaa!, Timon sees the lioness was about to close on Pumbaa and he is in the line of attack. At the last minute, Simba bounds over Pumbaa and catches the lioness head on at full force. They start fighting savagely.)

TIMON (To Simba.) Get her! Bite her head! Go for the jugular. The jugular! (To Pumbaa.) See, I told you he'd come in handy. (The lions tangle for a bit more. The fight becomes a wrestling. The lioness flips Simba and pins him with a loud thump. Simba is startled by this. The lioness is still baring her teeth. Simba, however, is very surprised and no longer threatening.) SIMBA Nala? (She immediately backs off and looks at Simba, examining him.) Is it really you? NALA Who are you? SIMBA It's me. Simba. NALA Simba? (Pause for realization.) Whoa!

(Simba and Nala run together and greet each other. The greetings are enthused.) NALA Well how did you... where did you come from? It's great to see you!! SIMBA Aaah! How did you... who... Wow! This is cool! It's great to see you! (Timon is completely baffled by this sudden change; Pumbaa is also baffled, but he’s still recovering from the panic.) TIMON Hey, what's goin' on here?! SIMBA (Still to Nala.) What are you doing here? NALA What do you mean, "What am I doing here?" What are you doing here?! TIMON Hey!! What's goin' on here!?!?! SIMBA Timon, this is Nala. She's my best friend. TIMON (Thoroughly confused.) Friend?!? SIMBA Yeah. Hey, Pumbaa, come over here. (Pumbaa fearfully approaches them.) SIMBA Nala, this is Pumbaa. Pumbaa, Nala. PUMBAA (Still huffing but with some friendliness.) Pleased to make your acquaintance. NALA The pleasure's all mine.

TIMON How do you do... Whoa! Whoa. Time out... Lemme get this straight. You know her. She knows you. But she wants to eat him. And everybody's... okay with this?! Did I miss something?!? SIMBA Relax, Timon. NALA Wait till everybody finds out you've been here all this time! And your mother... what will she think? SIMBA (Showing sadness and guilt.) She doesn't have to know. Nobody has to know. NALA Well, of course they do! Everyone thinks you're dead. SIMBA They do? NALA Yeah. Scar told us about the stampede. SIMBA He did? Well... What else did he tell you? NALA What else matters? You're alive, and that means... you're the King. TIMON King? Pbbb. Lady, have you got your lions crossed. Pumbaa: King? Your Majesty! I gravel at your feet. (Noisily kisses Simba's paw.) SIMBA Stop it! TIMON (To Pumbaa.) It's not "gravel." It's "grovel." And don't... he's not the King. (To Simba.) Are ya? SIMBA No.

NALA Simba? SIMBA No, I'm not the King. Maybe I was gonna be, but... that was a long time ago. TIMON Let me get this straight. You're the King? And you never told us? SIMBA Look, I'm still the same guy. TIMON (Enthusiastic.) But with power! NALA (Apologetic.) Could you guys... excuse us for a few minutes? TIMON Hey, (taps Pumbaa) whatever she has to say, she can say in front of us. Right, Simba? SIMBA Hmm. Maybe you'd better go. TIMON: (Aghast, then resigned.) It starts. You think you know a guy... (Pumbaa and Timon pad off. Pumbaa sighs.) SIMBA Timon and Pumbaa. You learn to love 'em. (Nala has her head bowed down sadly.) SIMBA What? ...What is it? NALA (Quietly.) It's like you're back from the dead. You don't know how much this will mean to everyone. (Pained expression.) ...What it means to me. SIMBA Hey, it's okay.

NALA (Rubbing under Simba's chin, purring.) I've really missed you. SIMBA (Startled by Nala's boldness for an instant, then reciprocating.) I've missed you too. (They are rubbing heads. We hear Timon, who’s spying behind the bushes, sigh.) TIMON (Heavy sigh.) I tell you, Pumbaa, this stinks! PUMBAA Oh. Sorry. TIMON Not you! Them!! Him. Her. All alone... PUMBAA What's wrong with that? “CAN YOU FEEL THE LOVE TONIGHT?” TIMON I CAN SEE WHAT’S HAPPENING, AND THEY DON’T HAVE A CLUE. THEY’LL FALL IN LOVE, AND HERE’S THE BOTTOM LINE: OUR TRIO’S DOWN TO TWO. THE SWEET CARESS OF TWILIGHT. THERE’S MAGIC EVERYWHERE. AND WITH ALL THIS ROMANTIC ATMOSPHERE, DISASTER’S IN THE AIR. FEMALE ENSEMBLE CAN YOU FEEL THE LOVE TONIGHT? THE PEACE THE EVENING BRINGS. THE WORLD FOR ONCE IN PERFECT HARMONY WITH ENSEMBLE ALL IT’S LIVING THINGS. MALE ENSEMBLE UTA LERATO WEH MAMELA UTA LERATO-WEH MAMELA LERATO-WEH PUMBAA What? Who?

Oh.

MALE ENSEMBLE MAMELA LERATO WEH (As the song progresses Simba and Nala walk around each other becoming more and more romantic each time, rubbing heads cat-like style. Timon and Pumbaa get more and more touched, not only by the romance but by the fact that their “trio is down to two.”) SIMBA SO MANY THINGS TO TELL HER, BUT HOW TO MAKE HER SEE. THE TRUTH ABOUT MY PAST, IMPOSSIBLE! SHE’D TURN AWAY FROM ME. NALA HE’S HOLDING BACK, HE’S HIDING. BUT WHAT, I CAN’T DECIDE. WHY WON’T HE BE THE KING I KNOW HE IS? THE KING I SEE INSIDE? SIMBA AND NALA CAN YOU FEEL THE LOVE TONIGHT? THE PEACE THE EVENING BRINGS? THE WORLD, FOR ONCE, IN PERFECT HARMONY WITH ALL ITS LIVING THINGS. ENSEMBLE MAMELA, MAMELA, MAMELA, UTA LERATO WEH MAMELA, MAMELA UTA LERATO WEH MAMELA LERATO WEH MAMELA LERATO WEH.

(The night starts setting in with all its magic.) SIMBA AND NALA CAN YOU FEEL THE LOVE TONIGHT? YOU NEEDN’T LOOK TO FAR. SIMBA, NALA, FEMALE ENSEMBLE STEALING THROUGH THE NIGHT’S UNCERTAINTIES, SIMBA, NALA, ENSEMBLE LOVE IS WHERE WE ARE. MALE ENSEMBLE MAMELA, MAMELA, MAMELA, UTA LERATO WEH MAMELA, MAMELA UTA LERATO WEH MALE ENSEMBLE MAMELA LERATO WEH

MALE ENSEMBLE MAMELA LERATO WEH NALA AND IF HE FEELS THE LOVE TONIGHT IN THE WAY I DO SIMBA IT’S ENOUGH FOR THIS RESTLESS WANDERER SIMBA AND NALA JUST TO BE WITH YOU. SIMBA Isn't this a great place? NALA It is beautiful. But I don't understand something. You've been alive all this time. Why didn't you come back to Pride Rock? SIMBA Well, I just needed to... get out on my own. Live my own life. And I did. And it's great. (He sounds almost as if trying to convince himself as well as Nala.) NALA (Voice catching, as though barely under control.) We've really needed you at home. SIMBA (Quieter.) No one needs me. NALA Yes, we do! You're the King! SIMBA Nala, we've been through this. I'm not the King. Scar is. NALA Simba, he let the hyenas take over the Pride Lands. SIMBA What?!

NALA Everything's destroyed. There's no food. No water. Simba, if you don't do something soon, everyone will starve. SIMBA I can't go back. NALA (Louder.) Why? SIMBA You wouldn't understand. NALA What wouldn't I understand? SIMBA (Hastily.) No, no, no... It doesn't matter. Hakuna Matata. NALA (Confused.) What? SIMBA Hakuna MATATA. It's something I learned out here. Look, sometimes bad things happen... NALA Simba! SIMBA (Continuing, irritated.) ...And there's nothing you can do about it. So why worry? (Simba starts away from Nala, but Nala walks back up to him.) NALA Because it's your responsibility! SIMBA Well, what about you? You left! NALA I left to find help! And I found you! Don't you understand? You're our only hope.

SIMBA Sorry. NALA What's happened to you? You're not the Simba I remember. SIMBA You're right. I'm not. Now are you satisfied? NALA No, just disappointed. SIMBA You know, you're starting to sound like my father. (Walking away again.)

NALA Good! At least one of us does. (Simba is obviously cut by the comment about his father; he tears into Nala with his words.) SIMBA (Angry.) Listen, you think you can just show up and tell me how to live my life?! You don't even know what I've been through! NALA I would if you would just tell me! SIMBA Forget it! NALA Fine! (Nala walks off. Timon and Pumbaa have also vanished. Night has fully set in and Rafiki is hiding from Simba in the shadows.) SIMBA She's wrong. I can't go back. What would it prove, anyway? It won't change anything. You can't change the past. (He looks up at the stars.)

SIMBA You said you'd always be there for me! But you're not. And it's because of me. It's my fault. It's my fault. “ASANTE SANA” RAFIKI ASANTE SANA! SQUASH BANANA! WE WE NUGU! MI MI APANA! (Simba seems slightly annoyed by the chant. He moves away. Rafiki, elated by the sight of Simba, follows him. Simba lies down. Rafiki, now in a nearby tree, starts his chant again.) RAFIKI ASANTE SANA! SQUASH BANANA! WE WE NUGU! MI MI APANA! SIMBA Come on, will you cut it out? (Rafiki, laughing, is doing random acrobatics in the trees nearby.) RAFIKI Can't cut it out. It'll grow right back! (Laughs.) (Simba starts walking away. Rafiki follows.) SIMBA Creepy little monkey. Will you stop following me? Who are you? RAFIKI (In front of Simba, then right in his face.) The question is: Whooo... are you? SIMBA (Startled, then sighing.) I thought I knew. Now I'm not so sure. RAFIKI Well, I know who you are. Shh. Come here. It's a secret. (She pulls Simba's head over to whisper into his ear. She

starts her chant into Simba's ear and laughs.) ASANTE SANA! SQUASH BANANA! WE WE NUGU! MI MI APANA! SIMBA Enough already! What's that supposed to mean, anyway? RAFIKI It means you are a mandrill, and I'm not. (Laughs.) SIMBA (Moving away.) I think... you're a little confused. RAFIKI (Magically in front of Simba again.) Wrong. I'm not the one who's confused; you don't even know who you are. SIMBA (Irritated, sarcastic.) Oh, and I suppose you know? RAFIKI Sure do; you're Mufasa's boy. (Simba is surprised by this revelation. Rafiki disappears off stage.) Bye! “LALA” ENSEMBLE WE SANGOMA NGI VELELWE WE BABA NGIVELELWE WE BABA NGIVELELWE SIMBA Hey, wait! (Simba chases after her. When he catches up, Rafiki is in a meditative lotus position on a rock.) SIMBA You knew my father?

RAFIKI (Monotone.) Correction... I know your father. SIMBA I hate to tell you this, but... he died... A long time ago. (Rafiki leaps off the rock over to a dense jungle-like area.) RAFIKI Nope. Wrong again! Ha, ha, hah! He's alive! And I'll show him to you. You just do what I tell you to. Old Rafiki, she knows... Now settle down and close your eyes... Look inside of yourself. To really know and understand the world, you must first know and understand yourself. “HEM” (While the chorus sings, Rafiki chants and dances around Simba sanctifying him with her jingling staff.) ENSEMBLE HEM... HEM, HEM... HEM, HEM. HEM... HEM, HEM... HEM, HEM... RAFIKI Now open your eyes... slowly. Turn your head towards the sky... See the star? See your father? SIMBA No, I only see stars. (Rafiki quickly but gently touches Simba in his head and heart with her staff as lighting flashes. Simba closes his eyes momentarily and then quickly opens them with the thunder.) RAFIKI Know yourself! Look inside! There he is... and you may find him everywhere... we are all One! (Deep rumbling noise.) RAFIKI You see, he lives in you! (Simba is awestruck. The wind picks up. A heavenly image of Mufasa forms in the sky, more clearly each time.) MUFASA (Quietly at first.) Simba . . .

SIMBA Father? MUFASA Simba, you have forgotten me. SIMBA No. How could I? MUFASA You have forgotten who you are, and so have forgotten me. Look inside yourself, Simba. You are more than what you have become. You must take your place in the Circle of Life. SIMBA How can I go back? I'm not who I used to be. (Mufasa glows in a golden light.) MUFASA Remember who you are. You are my son, and the one true King. (Close up of Simba's face, bathed in the golden light, showing a mixture of awe, fear, sadness, and love. The image of Mufasa starts to fade.) MUFASA Remember who you are. (Mufasa is disappearing rapidly into the darkness. Simba moves through the fields trying not to let go of his father’s image.) SIMBA No. Please! Don't leave me. MUFASA Remember... SIMBA Father! MUFASA Remember... SIMBA Don't leave me.

SIMBA Yeah, but it's not easy. I know what I have to do. But, going back means I'll have to face my past. I have to face myself. I've been running from this for so long... It hurts... RAFIKI Oh yes, the past can hurt and knowing yourself can be a challenge. But you can either run from them, or... learn from them. SIMBA I must go back... RAFIKI Good, good! Go on... (Simba starts running off.) SIMBA Yes, I must go back home. RAFIKI Good, go on. Get back home. “BUSA” (Laughs, hoots, n' hollers. As he holds his staff above his head, a few shooting stars zing across the sky. Music rises into celebratory "Busa" theme.) ENSEMBLE BUSA LE LIZWE

BUSA LE LIZWE BUSA LE LIZWE BUSA LOMLHABA SABUSA LE LIZWE SABUSA LE LIZWE SABUSA LE LIZWE BUSA LOMLHABA (It is morning in the jungle which is in the front stage, while in the back stage the jungle is discreetly becoming the ashen Pride Lands. Timon and Pumbaa are sleeping, snoring. Pumbaa is lying on his back. In his snore, Pumbaa occasionally mumbles "Grubs, grubs." Nala approaches and taps Timon with a paw.) NALA Hey. Hey, wake up. (Timon wakes up and sees a huge lion face in his view. He starts screaming and Pumbaa joins in.) NALA It's okay. Whoa, whoa. It's okay. It's me. TIMON Don't ever do that again! Carnivores, oy! NALA Have you guys seen Simba? TIMON (Holding a hand to his head.) I thought he was with you. NALA He was, but now I can't find him. Where is he? (We hear Rafiki's laugh; she's sitting in a tree above them.) RAFIKI Ho, ho, ho, ho. You won't find him here. Ha, ha. The King... has returned. NALA (Quietly.) I can't believe it. (Louder, amazed.) He's gone back.

TIMON Gone back? What do you mean? (Looks where Rafiki was; Rafiki is now gone.) Hey! What's goin' on here? Who's the monkey? NALA Simba's gone to challenge Scar. TIMON Who? NALA Scar. PUMBAA Who's got a scar?

NALA (Shaking her head.) No, no, no. It's his uncle. TIMON The monkey's his uncle? NALA No! Simba's gone back to challenge his uncle to take his place as King. TIMON AND PUMBAA Ohhh. BLACKOUT

SCENE 3 PRIDE LANDS (Simba reaches his former home, the barren Pride Lands. It is lacking in life, with a gray hue. Seeing the desolation, a look of determination, even fury, appears on Simba's face.) NALA Simba, wait up! (She comes up next to him.) It's awful, isn't it? SIMBA I didn't want to believe you... NALA What made you come back? SIMBA I finally got some sense sown into me. This is my kingdom. If I don't fight for it, who will? NALA I will. SIMBA It's gonna be dangerous. NALA (Quoting Young Simba.) Danger? Ha! I laugh in the face of danger. Ha, ha, ha, ha! TIMON I see nothing funny about this. SIMBA Timon? Pumbaa? What are you doing here? PUMBAA (Bowing on one foreleg.) At your service, my Liege. TIMON Uh. We're going to fight your uncle... for this?!

SIMBA Yes, Timon; this is my home. TIMON Ffh. Talk about your fixer-upper. Well, Simba, if it's important to you, (bows) we're with you to the end! (Simba smiles appreciatively. Nice scene with the four of them viewing the work ahead of them.) (Simba, Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa sneak up to the edge of Pride Rock. Hidden, they observe close up the hordes of hyenas.) TIMON Hyenas... Yikes! I hate hyenas. (To Simba, whispering.) So what's your plan for gettin' past those guys? SIMBA Live bait. TIMON Good idea. (Realizing.) Heeey! SIMBA Come on, Timon... you guys have to create a diversion. TIMON (Incredulous.) What do you want me to do? Dress in drag and do the Charleston? NALA Well, what a wonderful idea! Pumbaa, please give me a hand. (On hearing the music the hyenas gradually start moving to the music. With the help of Nala and Pumbaa, Timon quickly dresses up as a flapper. And then Timon wears a 1920s mafia-like beau hat and grabs a cigar.) “HAS ANYBODY SEEN MY PIG?” TIMON SIX FOOT TWO, LOTS TO CHEW, COME AND GET YOUR WARTHOG STEW. HAS ANYBODY SEEN MY PIG?

TIMON He’s such a ham! TIMON PURPLE TOES, HOLD YOUR NOSE, DON’T GO NEAR HIM ‘CASE HE BLOWS! DON’T YOU WANT A PIECE OF, HOW ABOUT A BITE OF, SINK YOUR TEETH INTO MY PIG! How ‘bout them hocks! Oink!

PUMBAA DOODLE-E ATN DOODLE-E ATN ZOOT ZOT ZADOT

(After the dance that greatly distracts them, several hyenas chase after Timon and Pumbaa off stage.) SIMBA Nala, you find my mother and rally the lionesses. (Determinedly.) I'll look for Scar. (Simba is making his way to Pride Rock. Scar calling his mother causes him to pause and watch.) SCAR Sarabi! (Sarabi ascends Pride Rock. The hyenas snap at her heels. She only glares disdainfully at them.) SARABI Yes, Scar? SCAR Where is your hunting party? They're not doing their job. SARABI (Calmly.) Scar, there is no food. The herds have moved on. SCAR No. You're just not looking hard enough! SARABI It's over. There is nothing left. We have only one choice. We must leave Pride Rock.

SCAR We're not going anywhere. SARABI Then you have sentenced us to death. SCAR Then so be it! SARABI (Disgusted, amazed.) You can't do that! SCAR I am the King! I can do whatever I want! SARABI If you were half the King Mufasa was, you would nev... (Scar hits Sarabi, knocking her to the ground.) SCAR I'm ten times the King Mufasa was!! (Simba appears on the ledge, growling loudly as lightning flashes. He leaps out and runs to his mother. Scar mistakes Simba as Mufasa and is understandably frightened.) SCAR Mufasa? Nooo!! It can’t be! You're dead!! (Sarabi awakens at her son's nudge, but mistakes him for Mufasa like Scar did.) SARABI Mufasa?! SIMBA No. It's me! SARABI (Delighted.) Simba? You're alive?! (Confused.) How can that be?!! SIMBA It doesn't matter. I'm home.

SCAR (Confused.) Simba...? (Back in form.) Simba! I'm a little surprised to see you, (giving the hyenas above him an angry look) alive... (On the word "alive", Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed gulp audibly and slink into the shadows.) SIMBA (To Scar as Sarabi looks on with some pride.) Give me one good reason why I shouldn't rip you apart. SCAR (Backing into a wall, apologetic.) Oh, Simba, you must understand. The pressures of ruling a kingdom... SIMBA ...Are no longer yours. Step down, Scar. SCAR Oh, oh, ye... Well, I would, heh, naturally, heh... however, there is one little problem. You see them? (Pointing to the horde of hyenas around them.) They think I'm King. (Nala appears with the rest of the lionesses.) NALA Well, we don't. Simba is the rightful King. SIMBA The choice is yours, Scar. Either step down or fight. SCAR Oh, must it all end in violence? I'd hate to be responsible for the death of a family member. Wouldn't you agree, Simba? SIMBA That's not gonna work, Scar. I've put it behind me. SCAR Eh, but what about your faithful subjects? Have they put it behind them? NALA Simba, what is he talking about?

SCAR (Delighted.) Ahh, so you haven't told them your little secret. Well, Simba, now's your chance to tell them. Tell them who is responsible for Mufasa's death! (Scar's last line causes the lionesses to start. All are concentrating on Simba.) SIMBA (Steeling himself, then taking a step forward.) I am. (Sarabi approaches her son.) SARABI (With much grief.) It's not true. Tell me it's not true! SIMBA (Regretfully.) It's true. SCAR You see! He admits it! Murderer!! (Thunder resounds and lightning flashes to punctuate the line.) SIMBA No! It was an accident. (Scar walks around and around Simba as he accuses him.) SCAR If it weren't for you, Mufasa would still be alive. It's your fault he's dead; do you deny it? SIMBA No. SCAR (Severely.) Then... you're... guilty!! SIMBA No! I'm not a murderer! SCAR Oh, Simba, you're in trouble again. But this time, Daddy isn't here to save you. And now everyone... knows... why!! (Scar has been backing Simba up the length of Pride Rock. After his last sentence, Simba slips over the edge and is clinging to the ledge by his forepaws. Lightning strikes again.)

“SIMBA CONFRONTS SCAR” NALA Simba!! (Scar sits back and pretends to think.) SCAR Now this looks familiar. Hmm... Where have I seen this before? Let me think. Hmmm... hmmm. Oh yes, I remember. This is just the way your father looked before he died. (Scar grabs Simba with his claws as he did Mufasa. He whispers into Simba's ear.) SCAR And here's my little secret: I killed Mufasa!! (Simba has a quick memory flash back to that fateful instant. Lightning continues to flash. In one giant leap he lunges up and pins Scar on his back. Scar is caught completely by surprise and is understandably very nervous and shaken.) SIMBA Nooooooooo!! ...Murderer! SCAR No, Simba, please!! SIMBA Tell them the truth!! SCAR Truth? But truth is in the eye of the behol- ! (Simba starts to choke Scar.) All right! All right! (Quietly, venomously.) I did it. SIMBA So they can hear you! SCAR (Grudgingly, but clear.) I killed Mufasa! (A fight ensues. The lions are fighting the hyenas and Pumbaa and Timon are charging them, too. Even Zazu is fighting them, and Rafiki is hitting them with her staff.

There is roaring, yelping, barking and screaming.) SIMBA (Quietly, severely.) Murderer. SCAR Simba, Simba. Please! Please have mercy! I beg you! SIMBA You don't deserve to live! SCAR But, Simba, I am... ah... (unsure of his tactic) family! It's the hyenas (regaining composure) who are the real enemy. It was their fault... it was their idea! (Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed are in the background. They overhear and back away growling at Scar's betrayal.) SIMBA Why should I believe you? Everything you ever told me was a lie!! SCAR What are you going to do? You wouldn't kill your old Uncle...? (Ingratiating grin.) SIMBA No, Scar. I'm not like you. SCAR (Greatly relieved.) Oh, Simba, thank you. You are truly noble. I'll make it up to you, I promise. How can I, ah, prove myself to you? Tell me; I mean, anything! SIMBA (Gravely, with deep anger.) Run! Run away, Scar!! And never return. SCAR Yes. Of course. As you wish... Your Majesty! (Scar treacherously attacks Simba. Lightning continues to flash. They fight and at some point Scar tumbles and is at the mercy of the hyenas. He weakly gets up. He sees Banzai, Shenzi, and Ed approaching and smiles. Ed has a very angry look on his face.) SCAR Ahh, my friends!

SHENZI Frie-he-hends? I thought he said we were the enemy! BANZAI Yeah, that's what I heard! BANZAI AND SHENZI Ed? ED (Laughs evilly.) SCAR (Very nervous.) No. L-l-l-le-le-le-le-let me explain! No! You don't understand. No! I didn't mean for... No, no! Look, I’m sorry I called you... No! Nooooo! (The horde of hyenas closes in on Scar dragging him off stage and devouring him. There is a change of music and gradually the Pride Lands recover their lush, rich state. Simba comes down and greets his mother and Nala. Rafiki motions for Simba to ascend Pride Rock as King. Simba starts up and pauses to hug Rafiki as his father did..) “KING OF PRIDE ROCK” RAFIKI It is time. (Very majestically, Simba ascends. Music is strong. Through a hole in the clouds we can see a patch of stars. One bright star shines out briefly.) (Simba's expression gains confidence and strength. He roars. The lionesses roar in reply. The savannah continues blooming. At some point Nala, Sarabi, Timon, Pumbaa and Zazu climb to Pride Rock and joins Simba. All the groups of herds are in the Pride Lands saluting Simba. Towards the end Rafiki appears, holding Kiara or Chaka, Simba’s and Nala’s offspring. She lifts him to present him to the crowd. The Circle is completed.)
